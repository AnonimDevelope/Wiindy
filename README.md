## How does it work

The app is built with help of Expo. Weather data is provided by [Openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/api), and cities search by [GeoDB Cities](https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities/endpoints). Weather icons are made with Lottie. The app is translated with i18n-js in English, Romanian and Russian. It notifies user about current weather in selected cities, has dark mode, and can display data in Imperial unit system or Metric.
